This is a toy project to introduce myself to interpreters & compilers as well as improve my C++ skills

The goal is to create:
    - a Chip8 interpreter, /also refered as 'VM' in the following document (and code)/.
    - a pseudo-assembly chip8 compiler.

The main work is currently done on the C++ branch. I first implemented the interpreter in C and I'm not transitioning to C++ while adding a GUI built on SFML.

* Getting Started
** Installation
    #+BEGIN_SRC bash
    git clone https://github.com/VrncQuentin/Chip8
    cd Chip8
    make install
    chip-8 -h
    #+END_SRC

    If you get something similar to the following you're good to go.
    #+BEGIN_SRC
    add help
    #+END_SRC

** Running
** Compiling
